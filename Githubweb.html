			<h2>Project:Github Website</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Github Website was the very first project given by the instructors teaching us in Engineering Academy(EA) during our first EA training. The start date of the project was on 29/04/2021. The task was to created a website throught the use of <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> in a week. Its purpose is for us to create a platform that would allow us document our future projects. This task also allow us to learn how to create a website and familarise ourselves with the different coding software we might use in our future endeavour.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>The very first thing that was taught was the importance of documenting our works. The premise of this is that it would help in creating a portfolio that we can use in the future. The instructors discussed with us the ways to documents them before talking about reasons to use github. The very first reason would be that github is absolutely free of charge. Secondly, it's easy to shared file and edits them between groupmates while using github. Finally, there isn't a need for an addition applications to render the file, such as in the case of Microsoft Word Document.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Afterwards, the instructor used an app called Github Atom(there are other apps with the most commonly used being the notepad) to show us what needs to be done, the different types command keys need to code the programme and how to upload the code onto Github. The language used to code the website is, as stated above, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. After the demostration, we were given free rein to try coding our website. There were videos given to us to answer some of our inquires.</p>

			<br>
			<p>As I still was confused, I decided to watch some of the videos provided. The videos by Jake Wright on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk&list=PLlj9BrHKq9WKaz8UV3BjEqicn-C3qHxy4"><b>HTML</b></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE"><b>CSS</b></a> gave a simplifed and easy-to-understand explanation about how it works. Afterwards, being a smart alec, I went to watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAZ8KzfhO8">video</a>(by Easy Tutorials) that had a nice templated but that was a Huge mistake as it had added on loads of questions where I had no answer to. The reason being half the steps that was taken when coding wasn't explained in detail. This caused me to search up every single unknown properties used in <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> on google taking me about 2.5 hours before i was finally done with it. I then had a relative smooth time writing down and testing my programme.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>After the programme was done, it was time to host it on Github. This step was relative easy except for a few minor issues I encountered.</p>
