			<h1>Site Purpose</h1>
			<p>The fast advancements of technology this past decade has brought in convenience to all areas of our life. This range from watching our favourite shows to buying thing more easily. However this hasn't made our life less busy but instead the opposite. Due to this type of busy schedule everyone face, it would be easy to forget what we might have done in the past year or even the past month. In an effort to help myself remember the activites I have participated in during my stay in SP(Singapore Polytechnic), I have created this site to document them down. This site would also be used to track my experiences in doing these projects, skills-learnt and mistakes made.</p>
